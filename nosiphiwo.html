				<p>Nosiphiwo Ndamase is 27-years-old, she was once a domestic worker and has been a sangoma for the past three years. Her mother and step-father are sangomas too. At the time of the interview her mother was involved in a ceremony in Gugulethu where they live. 
				</p>
				<p>Nosiphiwo no longer works as a domestic worker because employees wanted her to present her identity book, which she says was stolen from her. </p>
				<p>She is the oldest of seven children, and her family now survives off her mother’s salary, donations from community members that seek their assistance and social grants. </p>

				<p>When Nosiphiwo speaks about her past salary, she speaks about how over 43% of her daily payment went to transport and how she could travel for up to 3 hours to get to work on time. </p>
				<p>“It is difficult to be a sangoma at a young age, and to need to find work. I did not ask for this, my ancestors came to me and I had no choice,” says Nosiphiwo.</p>
				<p>But having been exposed to the life of a domestic worker, and through watching her mother receive R2000 per month for working 6 day weeks, she encourages other domestic workers to speak out.</p>
				<p>“Do not let anyone enslave you,” says Nosiphiwo. Yet at the same time, she stresses how she is desperate for work and would take “any work” to help support her siblings and parents. </p>
