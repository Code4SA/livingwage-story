				<p>Nosiphiwo walks barefoot between the corrugated iron shacks of Gugulethu. She is adorned with blue and white beaded anklets, bracelets and a long, dangling necklace. The remnant of white paint is seen around her eyes. “I was at a ceremony last night,” she says. “I have not even slept yet.” She is only 27-years-old, but has carried the “blessing and burden” of being a sangoma for the last three years.</p>
				
				<p>“I was a domestic worker before,” says Nosiphiwo upon reaching her shack. She sits down in one of two patched chairs, as her younger siblings gather around to listen to what she is saying. “But my identity book was stolen, and then I could not work anymore.”</p>
				
				<p>Nosiphiwo’s mother is a domestic worker and both her and her step-father are sangomas too. On the day of the interview her mother was at a traditional ceremony. </p>

				<p>“I am the oldest of seven children, so I try to bring in some money from donations for my work as a sangoma. My step-father and mother do the same, and we also rely on social grants,” says Nosiphiwo.</p>

				<p>"As a domestic worker, my mother is paid around R2,000 for working six days a week," says Nosiphowo. "She wants to quit, but where can she find better work? Her employer does not treat her well. Sometimes she can even hold back her salary if she does not feel like paying her."</p>

				<p>When Nosiphiwo reflects on her own past salary as a domestic worker, she speaks about how over 43% of her daily payment went to transport and how she could travel for up to three hours to get to work on time.</p>

				<h4>Living on R625 a month</h4>
				<p>With 21,005 people crowded into a small area, unemployment is rife, which results in a low household and individual income.</p>
				<p><div class="video-wrapper"><iframe id="cr-embed-ward-19100041-economics-employment_status" class="census-reporter-embed" src="http://embed.wazimap.co.za/static/iframe.html?geoID=ward-19100041&chartDataID=economics-employment_status&chartType=pie&chartHeight=200&chartQualifier=Universe%3A+Workers+15+and+over&chartTitle=Population+by+employment+status&initialSort=-value&statType=percentage" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="300" style="margin: 1em; max-width: 300px;"></iframe></div> </p>

				<p>There are 5,072 households in the area, which translates to 4.14 people per household.</p>
				<p><iframe id="cr-embed-ward-19100041-economics-individual_income_distribution" class="census-reporter-embed" src="http://embed.wazimap.co.za/static/iframe.html?geoID=ward-19100041&chartDataID=economics-individual_income_distribution&chartType=histogram&chartHeight=200&chartQualifier=Universe%3A+Employed+individuals&chartTitle=Employees+by+monthly+income&initialSort=&statType=scaled-percentage" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="300" style="margin: 1em; max-width: 720px;"></iframe>
				 </p>
				
				<p>The annual household income is only R29,400 per year, which works out to only R625 per person per month.</p>

				<h3>Ancestral Calling</h3>
				<p>“It is difficult to be a sangoma at a young age -- I did not ask for this, my ancestors came to me and I had no choice,” says Nosiphiwo.</p>

				<p>Nosiphiwo remembers how she was out with friends when visions and voices from her ancestors forced her to go home to speak to her mother and step-father about what she was experiencing. </p>

				<p>"My mother helps so many people as a sangoma. Sometimes they pay, sometimes they don't," she says. </p>

				<p>Her step-father emerges from his room, the only separate room to the communal area of the shack, clad in an impala skin hat, a flapping, patterned skirt and grasping a long beaded stick. He brings out his drum, and he and Nosiphiwo begin singing and dancing, attracting the attention of neighbours who gather at the door.</p>

				<p>Nosiphiwo does not mind the attention. Her time as a sangoma has taught her to speak openly and confidently. This, together with her experience as a domestic worker, and witnessing her mother's exploitation, has led her to encouraging other domestic workers to speak out.</p>

				<p>“Do not let any person make you enslaved,” says Nosiphiwo. "We all have families to support, you see? We all have wishes. So, if someone makes you a slave, speak it out." </p>

				<p>At the same time, Nosiphiwo stresses how she is desperate for employment and would take “any work” to help support her siblings and parents.</p>

				<h3>Family First</h3>
				
				<p>"I need to support my siblings. It is hard for them. My sister is in matric now, she needs stationery and books." Nosiphiwo did not finish her matric, but her 18-year-old sister wants to be a doctor when she finishes studying. She cleans the floor of the shack with muddied water in an attempt to keep the space clean for her family. </p>

				<p>When Nosiphiwo was still working as a domestic worker, 16.8% of her R1,920 monthly salary was spent on food for her family, 12% was spent on toiletries for herself, and she would spend over 20% on stationery for her siblings. </p>
				<div id="chart1" class="chart"></div>
				<p>"Now we get our money from different places each month, but it is a struggle." Nosiphiwo points to a the electrical box on the wall of the shack. A button is missing and she toys with the empty space with her finger. "You see this? We need this fixed. Like so many things here, we need this fixed." </p>
