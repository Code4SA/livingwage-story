				<h3>Fled on the back of a truck</h3>
				<p>Justine places a bowl of cooked cassava leaves alongside the fish and ugali (similar to South African pap, or maize meal) on her small dining room table. Her youngest daughter Grace (2) climbs onto on her lap, and Abigail (7) sits next to her, reaching across the table for another piece of fish. Her sister-in-law and husband roll the ugali between their fingers for easier eating. “We can find Congolese food in town,” says her husband, Clement. “We miss our home food too much otherwise.”</p>

				<p>In her apartment in Kuils River, a largely Afrikaans suburb east of Cape Town, Justine and her family share the space with another family. “We pay for our room, and for the use of the living room.” Members of the other family trickle through the front door, head to their room, closing the door quietly behind them. “It is too expensive otherwise,” says Justine. </p>

				<p>Justine fled the Democratic Republic of Congo eight years ago in the back of a truck. Warfare had spread through her home, and she had witnessed the murder and displacement of her closest family members. She spent the first four years raising her daughter, looking for work, and fighting for her refugee status. She eventually found work as a domestic worker. Through her employer, she was put in touch with a handful of new employers for whom she now works during the week. </p>

				<p>For Justine, her biggest priority is the safety, education and happiness of her children. "Sometime they might want to eat at Hungry Lion, or somewhere different, but how can we? There is no money at the end of each month. There is no money to save.”</p>

				<p>Occasionally, there is a crisis, and then careful monetary planning goes out the window. "My youngest one, Grace, pulled a cup of hot tea from the table. She burnt her neck and her face. We had to take her straight to the hospital." Luckily, Grace has healed well and the only memory of the incident is fading, keloid scar across her neck. "Now she is afraid to even drink tea," says Justine. </p>

				<p>Of her salary of R2,400, almost 63% is spent on groceries, 22% on transport for both her and her children, and 8% on nappies for Grace. </p>

				<p>Although the rent takes almost all of her husband's salary, Justine and Clement say they feel safer here than in a township, where threats and rumours of xenophobia hang heavily over the heads of foreigners. </p>

				<h3>A Foreigner in a Foreign Place</h3>
				
				<p>For Justine, living as a foreigner in a largely xenophobic environment, she carries both a social and a professional burden. “I have been struggling to get papers in South Africa, but am I still trying. Where can I go if I cannot stay here? I have no more family in the DRC.”</p>

				<p>She is currently appealing a rejection by the Refugee Court of Appeal for factual inconsistencies in her testimony. “They say I do not know the name of the road where I lived in the DRC. But it is not like South Africa,” she says, “we do not have road signs or road names in some areas. I could not even speak good English when I first arrived here and they asked me these questions I could not understand.” </p>

				<p>Justine and Clement face a barrage of poor logistical management common to asylum seekers entering the country. <a href="http://www.migration.org.za/uploads/docs/report-40.pdf">Research conducted by the African Centre for Migration and Society</a> revealed that three quarters of 1,400 interviewed asylum applicants reported that “what was written in their status determination decisions did not adequately reflect the information they provided during the interview”. More than half were unaware of how to appeal the decision of the Refugee Reception Office. </p>

				<p>Justine is among the half aware of her right to appeal, and now waits in limbo in the hope of being granted her refugee status.</p>

				<p>Her children, in the interim, have learnt to adapt to their environment too. “Aunty, aunty, come look at my book,” says Abigail, a heavy Afrikaans accent audible in her tone and choice of words. Attending an Afrikaans nursery school means Abigail’s accent does not carry the same French intonation of her parent’s accents.</p>

				<p>In fact, she is able to speak English, Afrikaans, KiSwahili, English, and even a bit of isiXhosa already. </p>

				<p>“I want my children to be educated,” says Justine. “But sometimes I do not have espérer, I do not have hope.”</p>
