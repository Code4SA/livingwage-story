				<h3>Fled on the back of a truck</h3>
				<p>Julia Galula has been a domestic worker for the past four years. She lives in Kuils River with her two daughters, ages seven and three, her sister-in-law, and her husband. Before she was a domestic worker, she was fleeing the Democratic Republic of Congo, where armed rebels had chased her and her family from their home. She had witnessed the death of her mother, and been the victim of assault. She fled in the back of a truck.</p>
				<p>For Julia, living as a foreigner in a largely xenophobic environment, she carried both a social and a professional burden. “I have been struggling to get papers in South Africa, but am I still trying. Where can I go if I cannot stay here? I have no more family in the DRC.”</p>
				<p>Julia has just been rejected by the Refugee Court of Appeal for factual inconsistencies in her testimony. “They say I do not know the name of the road where I lived in the DRC. But it is not like South Africa,” she says, “we do not have road signs or road names. I could not even speak good English when I first arrived here and they asked me these questions.”</p>

				<h3>Money for jam</h3>
				<p>Working for five different employers, all paying her varying salaries between R150 to R250 a day, she is earning R2,400 per month. Over 60% of this is spent on food, and almost 22% is spent on her transport to work, and her children’s transport to school.</p>
