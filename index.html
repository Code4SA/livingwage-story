				<h1>Under a Living Wage</h1>
				<p>Millions of South Africans don't have enough food to feed themselves, school their children, or get to work. Yet they work in our homes.</p>

				<p>There is an essential part of South Africa’s labour force that is both versatile and significantly undervalued. They cook, clean, babysit, act as security, occasionally as drivers, caretakers, do the laundry, walk the dogs and house sit. They are domestic workers, and according to the National Income Dynamics Study, they make up 8% of the economy. That is 1.2 million workers, or just over one in twelve people of South Africa’s work force.</p>

				<p>With numbers as high as these, the salaries of domestic workers should seemingly be something that South Africans know more about. And yet, to many, it is a topic that is met with aversion or discomfort. With only the minimum wage to turn to as a point of reference, employers might ask their neighbours, relatives or friends how much they are paying, and use their answers as the acceptable norm.</p>

				<p>As it stands, the Department of Labour stipulates that the minimum wage for domestic workers is R1,877.70 per month in metropolitan areas and R1,618.37 per month . These expenses are assuming a 45-hour week, equivalent to R9.63 an hour in the metropolitan areas and R8.30 in the rest of the country.</p>

				<p>South African Domestic Service and Allied Workers Union (SADSAWU) are calling for change, starting with a R2,500 minimum wage per month, just over R55/hour.</p>
				<strong>The jump from R8.30 to R55 per hour doesn't make sense</strong>

				<p>The minimum wage is meant to protect labourers from exploitation, yet unemployment figures often leave those seeking work silenced by desperation, fearful to ask or demand for more. If they did, would the minimum wage be enough?</p>

				<p>For each domestic worker, the expenses of travel costs, children’s education and number of mouths to feed may vary. Copying and pasting your neighbour’s reasoning or taking the minimum wage as gospel could leave domestic workers significantly underpaid and exploited. </p>

				<p>Fully aware of this void, Code4SA has designed a calculator based on research surrounding the basic expenses on which a domestic worker may have to spend her salary. The Living Wage calculator aims to pose the question:  is your domestic worker’s salary enough to cover her basic expenses? If it is, are the basics good enough? </p>

				<p>These domsetic workers' stories show glimpses into the salaries, expenses and lives of three domestic workers in the Western Cape. They aim to encourage dialogue between domestic workers and employees, and to stress the validity and importance in seeing this significant part of our labour force as individuals with varying needs, and personal aspirations. </p>
