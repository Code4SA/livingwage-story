				<p>Domestic workers are an essential -- and versatile -- part of South Africa’s labour force. They cook, clean, babysit, act as security, occasionally as drivers, caretakers, do the laundry, walk the dogs and house sit. There are 53 million domestic workers worldwide, which is almost the size of the South African population, according to the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/domestic-workers/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organisation</a>.</p>
				
				<p>And, in South Africa, domestic workers make up 6.8% of the employed population, according to the <a href="http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/p0211/p02114thquarter2012.pdf">Labour Force Survey</a>.</p>

				<p>With a workforce as large as this working in peoples’ homes, salaries of domestic workers should be something that South Africans know more about. And yet, to many, it is a topic that is met with aversion or discomfort when it is raised. With only the minimum wage as a point of reference, people often ask their neighbours, relatives or friends how much they are paying, and then use their responses as the acceptable norm.</p>
				
                <!--
				<p>The Department of Labour increased the minimum wage for domestic workers on 25 November 2014. As it stands, assuming domestic workers are working at least a 27 hour week, a monthly salary for domestic workers in metropolitan areas is R2,065.47 and R1,812.57 outside metropolitan areas. These expenses are equivalent to R10.95 an hour and R9.30 an hour respectively.</p>-->
                <p>The Department of Labour published <a href="http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/legislation/sectoral-determinations/basic-conditions-of-employment/Correction%20Notice%20Domestic%20worker%202014.pdf">amended figures</a> late last year prescribing minimum wages for domestic workers for the period from December 1, 2014 to November 30, 2015. These set the monthly salary for domestics in metropolitan areas who work more than 27 hours at R2,065.47, or R10.59 per hour. Outside metropolitan who work areas, the monthly salary is R1,812.57, or R9.30 an hour. </p>
                <p>For those  domestics working less than 27 hours per week in metropolitan areas, the <a href="http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/legislation/sectoral-determinations/basic-conditions-of-employment/Domestic%20worker%20amendment%202014.pdf">stipulated monthly salary</a> is R1,450.33, or R12.40 an hour. Outside the metropolitan areas for those working less than 27 hours per week, the monthly and hourly pay is R1,284.09 and R10.98 respectively.</p>

                <p>So how does this compare to the salaries of workers in other sectors of the South African economy? 
                    <ul>
                        <li>From 1 March 2015, the minimum wage for <a href="http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/legislation/sectoral-determinations/basic-conditions-of-employment/farmworkerwages2015.pdf">farm labourers</a> will be set at R2,606.78 a month, or R13.37 an hour;</li>
                        <li>In the contract cleaning sector, the <a href="http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/legislation/sectoral-determinations/basic-conditions-of-employment/contractcleaning_jan2015.pdf">minimum hourly wage</a> for the metropolitan and local councils of City of Cape Town, Ekurhuleni, City of Johannesburg, City of Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Local Councils: Emfuleni, Merafong, Mogale City, Metsimaholo, Randfontein, Stellenbosch and Westonaria is R16.98, and R15.47 for the rest of the RSA.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The Department of Labour clearly stipulates: “If the transport cost is more than the daily cost to an employee [in the contract cleaning sector], an employer who requires such an employee to perform night work must subsidize such employee for the transport expenses.”</p> 
                <p>This does not apply to domestic workers, putting them at increased risk of exploitation.

				<p>The South African Domestic Service and Allied Workers Union (SADSAWU) <a href="http://groundup.org.za/article/r1-hour-not-enough-says-domestic-workers-union_2477">is calling for change</a>, starting with a R2,500 minimum wage per month.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>"When you look at a domestic workers wage, how do we justify it ? What do we base it on? What is the value of a domestic worker? It is a question we should ask society. It is a question we  should ask our department of labour." -- Myrtle Witbooi, General Secretary SADSAWU</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>The minimum wage is meant to protect labourers from exploitation, yet unemployment figures often leave those seeking work silenced by desperation, fearful to ask or demand more.</p>

				<p>And even if they did, would the minimum wage be enough to cover their basic needs?</p>

				<p>For each domestic worker, the expenses of travel costs, children’s education and number of mouths to feed varies. Copying and pasting your neighbour’s reasoning or taking the <a href="http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/media-desk/media-statements/2014/labour-minister-oliphant-upwardly-adjusts-domestic-workers2019-annual-wages">minimum wage</a> as gospel could leave domestic workers significantly underpaid and exploited.</p>
				
				<p>Fully aware of this void, <a href="http://www.code4sa.org">Code for South Africa</a> has designed a calculator based on research surrounding the basic expenses on which a domestic worker may have to spend their salary. The sources include StatsSA and the National Income Dynamics Study. The Living Wage calculator poses the question: is your domestic worker’s salary enough to cover basic expenses? </p>
				
				<p>We followed the stories of three domestic workers  in the Western Cape. The videos, text and graphs aim to encourage dialogue between domestic workers and employers, and to stress the validity and importance in seeing this significant part of our labour force as individuals with varying needs, and personal aspirations. This calculator is not an end-point, but rather aspires to trigger discussion on a topic often neglected and undervalued. </p>
