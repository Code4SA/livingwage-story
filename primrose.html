				<h3>Sole Breadwinner</h3>

				<p>Primrose’s maternal instincts are immediately visible in the way she has arranged her small, corrugated iron shack in Khayelitsha, a “black township” to the East of the leafy Cape Town Southern Suburbs. The walls inside are painted pink, a collection of dolls lie on the white, lace pillow on her bed, and a small sign with letters spelling ‘Home’ sit on her bedside table. The township has been her home for the last 17 years, 15 of which she has been a domestic worker. </p>

				<p>“I have two beds because one is meant for me and my grandchild, the other is for my youngest son. But they both like to sleep in the bed with me,” laughs Primrose, as she hangs up her granddaughter’s dresses on the washing line outside her shack. Born later in her life, her youngest son (4) is younger than her granddaughter (7). </p>

				<p>For Primrose, her family has always been the driving force behind becoming a domestic worker. It has been a decision of survival. "I did get my matric in 1991," she says, "but I had two children at my early age so I couldn't further my studies. I have been a breadwinner for three children, and now my grandchild too. I had to sacrifice my life for them." Primrose works as a char for five different employers in Cape Town’s Southern Suburbs. </p>

				<p>Every day of the week, Primrose catches a minibus taxi from Khayelitsha to her job. “Sometimes it can take me up to one hour to get to work,” she says. Her transport costs her around R600 a month, 15% of her monthly salary of R4,000. </p>

				<p>One of her highest expenses is also food, although she spends surprisingly little on feeding three mouths. Almost 38% of her salary, or R1,500, goes to groceries each month. "I am a domestic worker because I want a better life for my children. It is a job, it is better than nothing, but I wouldn't want my children to be domestic workers." She speaks about the difficulties of always remaining patient, of doing work that is unenjoyable, repetitive and frustrating. </p>
				
				<div id="chart1" class="chart"></div>

				<p>"If I was not a domestic worker, my dream job would be to be a social worker, to help people. So if I could get that chance, I would do it, even now, because I like to see other people happy,” she says. </p>

				<h3>Education First</h3>
				
				<p>"Things didn't work out", says Primrose about her marriage, and since then she has been the breadwinner for her children, and now her granddaughter too. She paid for her daughter's tertiary education but she got sick and could not complete it. She is now living in her family’s hometown in the Transkei with other family members.</p>

				<p>Now, Primrose sets money aside each month for her son's living expenses and education. It is her biggest expense. </p>

				<p>"He is studying to be a lawyer through UNISA," says Primrose. "Sometimes he might need smart clothes, or a suit, so I need to have money to help him with those things."</p>

				<p>She sets aside R1,000 a month for her son’s expenses and also saves intermittently to pay for his UNISA fees of R10,000 a year. </p>

				<p>Primrose is part of the 71% of domestic workers who are the sole providers of income in their households. (Source: National Income Dynamics Survey, UCT). </p>
