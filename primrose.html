				<h3>Sole Breadwinner</h3>

				<p>Primrose has been a domestic worker for 15 years. She feels it’s a difficult job, involving being incredibly patient, and not one that she’d like her own children to pursue. If she weren’t a domestic worker, she would want to be a social worker because she likes to help people and see them happy.</p>

				<p>Primrose has been a resident of Khayelitsha for over 17 years, a “black township” to the East of the leafy Cape Town Southern Suburbs. She is the breadwinner for her four children, and now her first grandchild too. She has been promised toilets in her area for the last two years, but still has to use a bucket at night or face a dangerous walk to the communal toilets.</p>

				<p>She has five different employees, each of whom pays her a different amount. Primrose says that she has no say in her pay, with each employer deciding on the daily rate.</p>

				<h3>Education First</h3>
				
				<p>As the breadwinner, Primrose has chosen to spend her money on something she deems one of her most important expenses: education. “This is such a big thing to me. I have always wanted my children to have a better education than I did. I got my matric, but then had to give up furthering my education for them. I gave up my life for them.”</p>
				<p>From her monthly expenses, Primrose sets aside R1,000 a month for her son’s expenses and also saves intermittently to pay for his UNISA fees of R10,000 a year. “He is studying to be a lawyer,” says Primrose.</p>
				<p>Primrose is part of the 71% of domestic workers who are the sole providers of income in their households. (Source: Statistics South Africa National Income Dynamics Survey.)</p>
